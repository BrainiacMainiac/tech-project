The height slider determines the height (in cells) of the maze, and the width slider does the same for the width. Just slide them to the numbers you want.

This increases the amount of time it takes for mazes to be solved or generated so that you can see what is happening. It can be toggled during generation or solving.

This button saves the maze as a PNG image file with the specifed name. It is saved to the same folder as the program.

This button removes all marks from maze solving from the maze, leaving an empty maze for saving or resolving.

This button generates the maze using the selected maze generation option.

This button solves the maze using the selected maze generation option.

This algorithm solves the maze by going down random paths until it finds the exit.

This algorithm solves the maze by following all paths at the same time to find the shortest solution.

This algorithm solves the maze by filling in all dead ends until only the correct path to the exit remains.

This algorithm generates the maze by removing random walls across the maze.

This algorithm generates the maze by going through the maze, removing walls that are in its path.

This algorithm generates the maze by creating walls criscrossing the maze, then putting small holes in them.
